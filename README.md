# Half Punch Man Challenge Tracker

Welcome to the Half Punch Man Challenge Tracker! This web application is inspired by the One Punch Man Challenge, but with a twist â€“ the challenge values are halved, making it more accessible and customizable for users.

## About the Challenge (TBD)

The Half Punch Man Challenge is a fitness regimen that involves completing 50 push-ups, 50 sit-ups, 50 squats, and a 5-kilometer run each day for 50 days. This challenge aims to promote consistent exercise and physical activity, all while adapting to your own fitness level.
